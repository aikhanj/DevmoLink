# Cursor Configuration for devmolink - Tinder-style Hackathon Matching App

# Project Context
project:
  name: "devmolink"
  description: "A Tinder-style swipe app for hackathon matching, connecting developers, designers, and entrepreneurs"
  type: "web-app"

# Technology Stack
stack:
  - "Next.js 15"
  - "TypeScript"
  - "TailwindCSS"
  - "Firebase (Auth, Firestore)"
  - "React"

# AI Assistant Rules
rules:
  - "Focus on mobile-first responsive design with smooth gesture interactions"
  - "Prioritize performance and fluid animations for swipe gestures"
  - "Use TailwindCSS utilities and avoid custom CSS when possible"
  - "Follow Next.js 15 app directory conventions and server/client component patterns"
  - "Implement Firebase best practices for real-time data and authentication"
  - "Ensure accessibility (WCAG guidelines) in all UI components"
  - "Use TypeScript strictly - no 'any' types unless absolutely necessary"
  - "Optimize for touch interactions and mobile gesture handling"
  - "Keep components small, reusable, and well-documented"
  - "Use React hooks effectively for state management and side effects"
  - "Implement proper loading states and error handling for better UX"
  - "Follow atomic design principles for component organization"
  - "Make sure the LLM puts unique ids on every div tag so when you need to communicate changes you have a way to explain it."

# Code Style Preferences
style:
  - "Use functional components with hooks over class components"
  - "Prefer arrow functions for component definitions"
  - "Use descriptive variable and function names"
  - "Keep files under 200 lines when possible"
  - "Use absolute imports with proper path mapping"
  - "Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures"

# UI/UX Focus Areas
ui_priorities:
  - "Smooth card swiping with physics-based animations"
  - "Intuitive gesture recognition (swipe left/right, tap, hold)"
  - "Responsive design that works on all screen sizes"
  - "Fast loading with skeleton screens and optimistic updates"
  - "Consistent design system with reusable components"
  - "Micro-interactions that provide user feedback"
  - "Dark/light mode support"
  - "Progressive web app features"

# Firebase Patterns
firebase_patterns:
  - "Use Firebase Auth for secure user authentication"
  - "Implement real-time Firestore listeners for live chat and match updates"
  - "Optimize Firestore queries with proper indexing"
  - "Use Firebase Storage for profile images with proper compression"
  - "Implement offline support with Firestore offline persistence"
  - "Use Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side logic when needed"

# Performance Optimizations
performance:
  - "Implement image lazy loading and optimization"
  - "Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations"
  - "Implement virtual scrolling for large lists"
  - "Use Next.js dynamic imports for code splitting"
  - "Optimize bundle size with tree shaking"
  - "Implement proper caching strategies"

# Gesture and Animation Libraries
recommended_libraries:
  - "@use-gesture/react for advanced gesture handling"
  - "framer-motion for smooth animations"
  - "react-spring for physics-based animations"
  - "react-intersection-observer for scroll-based animations"
  - "next/image for optimized image handling"

# Component Architecture Guidelines
component_guidelines:
  - "Create reusable UI components in src/components/ui/"
  - "Keep business logic in custom hooks"
  - "Use compound components for complex UI patterns"
  - "Implement proper prop interfaces with JSDoc comments"
  - "Create stories for components when building complex interactions"

# Testing Preferences
testing:
  - "Write unit tests for utility functions and custom hooks"
  - "Implement integration tests for critical user flows (swipe, match, chat)"
  - "Use React Testing Library for component testing"
  - "Test gesture interactions and animations"

# Common Patterns for This App
app_patterns:
  - "Card stack with swipe gestures for profile browsing"
  - "Real-time chat with message persistence"
  - "Match notifications and animations"
  - "Profile creation and editing with image upload"
  - "Filtering and discovery preferences"
  - "Team formation and project matching logic"

# API Design
api_patterns:
  - "Use Next.js API routes for server-side operations"
  - "Implement proper error handling with HTTP status codes"
  - "Use middleware for authentication and validation"
  - "Structure API responses consistently"
  - "Implement rate limiting for user actions"

# Security Considerations
security:
  - "Validate all user inputs on both client and server"
  - "Implement proper CSRF protection"
  - "Use Firebase Security Rules for data access control"
  - "Sanitize user-generated content"
  - "Implement proper session management"
